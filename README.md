Fetch basic TV series information from [The TVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com/) API and send information to standard output.

A small C++ application to pratice [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Conan](https://conan.io/) and  OAuth API consumption using the [cpr](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr) library.

Unrust and update my C++ practice. Nothing to see here.
